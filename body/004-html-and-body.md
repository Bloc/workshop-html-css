### Objectives

After this exercise, you should be able to:

- Identify the `<html>` and `<body>` tags
- Describe the order of these tags
- Describe the importance of each tag

### Example

The text you've written thus far belongs to the visual content of the HTML document. This is called the document's **body**, and we surrounded it with `<body>` tags.

The document's body is one part of an HTML document (we'll get to the other part — the document's **head** — later.) And we surround the `<body>` tags with `<html>` tags, like so:

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <p>Some content goes here.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

`<html>` indicates the beginning, and `</html>` indicates the end of your HTML document.

It may seem overly verbose, but these formatting rules help web browsers display your documents properly. Without them, browsers may display your content incorrectly, may take longer to display it, or may not display it at all.

### Exercise

1. Open `index.html`
2. Place `<html>` and `<body>` tags around your content.
