### Objectives

After this exercise, you can:

- Use CSS to improve the look of your profile

### Example

Your profile was pretty bomb after you updated it last, but it looked a little bare. Let's use CSS to style it up a bit!

### Exercise

For this exercise, we'll provide suggestions but you can style your profile any way you wish.

- Create a file named, "profile.css."
- Open "profile.html"
  - Add a `<link>` to your `profile.css` file.
- Using a mix of HTML and CSS, consider making the following modifications:
  - Align your profile image to the left.
  - Force your profile image into a square shape.
    - Place your name heading and your "about me" paragraph into a single `<div>`.
    - Place this `<div>` right next to your profile image.
    - Add left margin to your `<div>` to give your profile image some room.
  - Remove the borders of your table leaving only a single dividing line in between each entry
  - Alternate the background color of each table row using an [nth-child selector](https://css-tricks.com/how-nth-child-works/)
  - Use the `:hover` [pseudo-class](http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_pseudo_classes.asp) to increase the size of each of your fears as the user mouses over them!
- Have fun, play around, and make your profile spectacular!
